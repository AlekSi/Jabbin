Requirements
------------

* You need Qt 4.4 or higher to build Jabbin. If a packaged version of Qt is not
available for your OS (or if you want debug symbols in your Qt libraries), you
will need to build and install Qt 4.4 yourself. See the Qt instructions to find
out how to do this.

* You need QCA 2.0 and the QCA OpenSSL plugin, which you can get at
		http://delta.affinix.com/qca/2.0/beta2
Instructions on how to build these packages can be found below.

The 'Building QCA' and 'Building QCA the OpenSSL plugin' sections can be
skipped by downloading the sources of these packages, and unpackaging them
in third-party/qca (see the INSTALL file for the exact location of each
package).

* You need Speex library 1.2rc1 sources which you can get at
		http://www.speex.org/downloads/ 

* You need libexpat-2.0.1 which you can get at
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/ 

This is a list of packages needed to build Jabbin on Linux :
libqt4-core
libqt4-dev
g++
libqca2
libqca2-dev
libssl-dev
zlib-bin
libspeex-dev
libphonon-dev
libexpat1-dev
libsm-dev
libxext-dev


Building QCA
------------

After unpacking the QCA sources, run the following command:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/qca2

If configure cannot find your Qt4 library, use the --qtdir option to specify
the path to Qt (e.g. /usr/share/qt4), or make sure that the qmake binary for
Qt4 occurs first in your PATH. If something else goes wrong, use the --debug
option to get more information on the configuration process.

After QCA configured, run

 make
 make install

To be able to run applications using QCA2, you will need to add
/usr/local/qca2/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig, or add
/usr/local/qca2/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.



Building the QCA OpenSSL plugin
-------------------------------
After unpacking the QCA OpenSSL plugin's sources, run the following commands

 ./configure
 make
 make install

See above on how to troubleshoot configure problems.



Building the QCA GnuPG plugin
-------------------------------
After unpacking the QCA GnuPG plugin's sources, run the following commands

 ./configure
 make
 make install

See above on how to troubleshoot configure problems.


Patching the 3rd party libraries
--------------------------------

Patch the third-party libraries with the
  linux/0001-3rd_party_libs_linux_gcc_4x-ivan.patch

run patch -p0 <   linux/0001-3rd_party_libs_linux_gcc_4x-ivan.patch

Building libjingle
------------------
Run the following commands inside the third-party/libjingle-0.4.0 directory
 qmake
 make

Building libjrtp
------------------
Run the following commands inside the third-party/jrtplib directory
 qmake
 make

Building Jabbin
---------------

From the toplevel Jabbin source dir, run the following commands:

 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/jabbin
 make
 make install

This should configure, build, and install Jabbin. See above on how to troubleshoot
configure problems.

Roster iconset README
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For general information about creation of iconsets, see psi/libpsi/iconset/ICONSET-HOWTO.
This file contains only required icon names and some details about them.

Read a little note about animations in the README for the system iconsets.

Note: how to add service iconsets: modify src/psiiconset.cpp and add new service RegExp,
add the default iconset name to profiles.cpp, and add your iconset to common.cpp's
category2icon() (and don't forget to add entry to lv_isServices in ui_options.ui).

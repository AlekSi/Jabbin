This plugin provides SASL (GSSAPI mechanism only) using the native Windows
Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) for Kerberos.  Basically what this
means is that if your Windows computer authenticates against a domain, then
you can access capable SASL servers on that domain without a password.

This plugin will safely load on any version of Windows, but it will only
perform its function if the Kerberos SSPI feature is present (available in
Windows 2000 or later).

This test is intended to verify the subject hostname indication
extension (see RFC3546 Section 3.1).

It requires network access, and contacts a public test server
(sni.velox.ch).

Note that this test requires a suitable backend (plugin). If
you are running this test with OpenSSL 0.9.8 or earlier, then
you can expect it to fail.

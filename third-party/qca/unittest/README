This directory holds simple unit tests for QCA.

You can run the whole test suite by doing "make test" in this
directory. You can also run a single set of tests by doing "make test"
in the applicable subdirectory. See "TestPlan" for more detail. 

The unittests were originally designed to be run through cmake,
however they should work just fine without it. Please report any
problems.

The "testcerts" directory is not a unit test. It is the tools used
to generate certificates used in unit tests, and is a copy of the 
CA.pl script and associated configuration file provided with openssl. 

These tests are implemented using the QTestLib test framework provided
with Qt 4.1 and later. If you are having trouble with a test, you can
get more information by running the test applicable directly (e.g. if
you can't make the Base64 test work, you run the ./base64unittest
executable) with the -v1 or -v2 options. You can also specify a single
test to be run. 

Thanks to Trolltech for providing Qt and agreeing to release QTestLib,
especially to Harald Fernengel for all the development work, a great
tutorial at Akademy 2005 and substantial assistance with QTestLib.

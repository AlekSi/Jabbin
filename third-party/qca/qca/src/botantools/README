Botantools 1.6.2
----------------

Botan is written by Jack Lloyd and available at http://botan.randombit.net/

Description (from the website) :
  Botan is a library, written in C++. It's main purpose it to provide an easy
  to use, high level interface to various cryptographic primitives, such as
  block ciphers, hash functions, and public key algorithms. In addition, the
  intent is that Botan is as general purpose as possible, and for this reason,
  it supports many standards and de-facto standards.

"Botantools" is a subset of Botan, tailored for use with QCA.  It includes
only the memory allocation, memory locking, and big integer capabilities.  To
use it, just include botantools.pri in your qmake profile, and botantools.h in
your code.

The 'botan' subfolder consists of files just from Botan.  Inside are source
files (originally from Botan's 'src' folder) as well as some modules (from
'modules').  The further 'botan' subfolder contains headers (from 'include'
and modules).

Some files had to be modified, and botantools.diff contains the differences.
Also, license headers and namespace declarations were added to all source
files, but I don't count these as real modifications, and they are not
included in the diff.  The addlicenseheaders.sh script can be used to apply
the license headers.  To apply the namespace declarations, build wrapns.c and
use the addnamespace.sh script.

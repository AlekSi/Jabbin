Installing QCA
--------------

QCA requires Qt 4.2 or greater.

For Unix/Linux/Mac:

  ./configure
  make
  make install
  /sbin/ldconfig, if necessary

For Windows:

  configure
  nmake (or make)
  installwin


Notes
-----
  - On unix, use --prefix=$PWD to build in-place


Building from SVN
------------------
First, install the 'qconf' program, at least version 1.5.  You can download
the source here:
  http://delta.affinix.com/qconf/

Then, go into the QCA source tree and type 'qconf'.  You should now have a
configure program to execute, just like from a normal source package.

/**
 * \class VariantTree
 * \brief A recursive structure for storing QVariants in trees, with comments
 * 
 * All the methods in this class are recursive, based on a hierachy delimited 
 * with dots in the node name. As such, the nodes "Paris" and "Benvolio" are 
 * top level elements (members of this layer), while "Capulet.Juliet" is a 
 * member of a deeper node ("Capulet") and "Verona.Montague.Romeo" represents 
 * the node "Romeo" which is a member of "Montague", which is again a member
 * of "Verona" (which is a member of this layer).
 * 
 * As such, for each function, if the supplied node contains a dot ("."), 
 * the node name is split at the first (if there are several) dot, with the 
 * remainder passed to the same method of the member of this node with the 
 * name given by the primary component. For the set methods, multiple layers
 * in the hierachy may be created implicitly if the node is not found.
